This is an android application is a clone of instagram. This works on the custom backend server. The custom backen server is Parse server. 
The user login and signup is efficiently handled by Parser Server. Also, each and every user has the functionality of viewing other users profiles and their feeds.
Every user also has the ability to share images from their gallery or camera. The application rightly remebers the last person who has logged in into the application and doesnt log out 
of the application until the user decides to log out.
